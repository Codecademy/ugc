### Introduction
Next.js is an open-source React framework that enables you to create server-rendered, static generated, and hybrid web applications. It provides a number of features that make it easy to build high-performance web applications, including:

- Static site generation: Next.js can be used to generate static websites that are served directly from the browser. This can improve performance and SEO.
- Server-side rendering: Next.js can also be used to render pages on the server. This can improve performance for search engines and users who are not using JavaScript.
- Hybrid rendering: Next.js can also be used to combine server-side rendering and static site generation. This gives you the best of both worlds: performance and SEO.
- Automatic routing: Next.js provides automatic routing that makes it easy to create complex web applications with nested routes.
- Data fetching: Next.js provides a number of ways to fetch data from APIs, including asynchronous async/await and the fetch() API.
- Internationalization: Next.js supports internationalization, so you can easily create web applications that support multiple languages.
- Deployment: Next.js can be deployed to a variety of hosting services, including Vercel, Netlify, and AWS Amplify, DigitalOcean.

This tutorial will cover the creation of a NextJs app and Deploying it on Caprover(Opensource Platform as a service) using DigitalOcean and Github actions.
